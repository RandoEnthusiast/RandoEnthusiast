Heya!
I'm @RandoEnthusiast, or Brutus if thy so prefers

My username is/was inspired by the KH2 randomizer mod that i like to play

----------------------------------

At the current moment I'm working on Arena fighter (tkinter game, v.1.0.0 out in february 2026 at the latest).

My second project is a game i'm still working on the story, world and characters for.
----------------------------------

On top of that my next learning objectives are:

1. Pygame library, making a 2d game with animation (probably Arena fighter remake)

2. learning general c++ (general language concepts, how to utilize them etc)

3. learning some sort of rendering library like opengl for making my own game
4. addition to 3. probably something simple at first, just to get how gpu pipeline is used and programmed

-------------------------------

current languages and skill

1. Python -- enough to get the job done. mostly just learning unique library call convections but basic stuff is in the bag.

2. C++ -- what is usable from python. basic logic, if conditions, variables and the like. basic programming fundementals
