Heya!
I'm @RandoEnthusiast, or Brutus if thy so prefers

My username is/was inspired by the KH2 randomizer mod that i like to play

----------------------------------

At the current moment I'm working on a 2d remake of Arena fighter (tkinter garbage).

Arena Fighter (1st game project) no longer in active developement. Final release possible but not promised

----------------------------------

On top of that my next learning objectives are:

1. Pygame library, making a 2d game with animation (probably Arena fighter remake)

2. learning general c++ (general language concepts, how to utilize them etc)

3. in the future learning to implement what i know from graphics wise programming in C++

-------------------------------

current languages and skill

1. Python -- enough to get the job done. mostly just learning unique library call convections but basic stuff is in the bag.

2. C++ -- what is usable from python. basic logic, if conditions, variables and the like. basic programming fundementals
